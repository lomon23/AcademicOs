## 🚀 About The Project

**Academic OS** is not just another to-do list. It is a comprehensive desktop ecosystem designed for students who want to treat their life and studies as a managed project. 

Born from the need to have a fast, native, and distraction-free tool, Academic OS combines task management, financial tracking, and personal analytics into one cohesive interface.

### ✨ Key Features

* **📊 Dashboard Hub:** A customizable overview of your day. See your tasks, financial balance, and activity charts at a glance.
* **✅ Advanced To-Do System:** * Infinite task nesting (sub-tasks).
    * Color-coded categories.
    * **Live Progress Tracking:** Visual bars that update in real-time.
* **📈 Analytics Engine:** Visualizes your productivity. Track your habits, sleep, or study hours with dynamic graphs (powered by QCustomPlot).
* **💳 Wallet Manager:** Keep track of your finances, set goals, and monitor expenses.
* **📅 Academic Calendar:** A clean, dark-themed calendar to keep track of exams and deadlines.
* **📝 Daily Check-in:** A routine module to log your state, budget, and mood.
