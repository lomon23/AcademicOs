## About The Project

**Academic OS** is not just another to-do list. It is a comprehensive desktop ecosystem designed for students who want to treat their life and studies as a managed project. 

Born from the need to have a fast, native, and distraction-free tool, Academic OS combines task management, financial tracking, and personal analytics into one cohesive interface.
